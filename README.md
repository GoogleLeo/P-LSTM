# P-LSTM

Here I proposed an Alternative method that combined Recurrent Neural Network With Information Propgation to predict stock movement

1. Problem formulation: Assume we have a group of companies, each of which we have its stock information in several months. We would like to predict its stock movement is the immediate Coming month.

2. File Discription: 
 "Graph" is the data of constructed graph, which is constructed by the Data structrue of NetworkX; "Data_Preprocessing.py" is the Proporcessing od the data which build the "Graph" and obtained the feautures from the Graph; "Model.py" and "Training.py" is the file where l constructed the Recurrent Neural Network and Trained it; The rest of the files are all the data I obtained from the Internet and preprocessed.
 
3. Result:
